Domain Specific Tools # A large number of third party packages extend and build on Matplotlib\n          functionality, including several higher-level plotting interfaces\n          (seaborn, HoloViews, ggplot, ...), and a projection and mapping\n          toolkit (Cartopy). More Domain-Specific Tools seaborn Cartopy DNA Features Viewer plotnine WCS Axes seaborn seaborn is a high level interface for drawing statistical graphics\n              with Matplotlib. It aims to make visualization a central part of\n              exploring and understanding complex datasets. statistical data visualization Cartopy Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data\n              processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data\n              analyses. Cartopy DNA Features Viewer DNA Features Viewer is a Python library to visualize DNA features,\n              e.g. from GenBank or Gff files, or Biopython SeqRecords. DNA Features Viewer plotnine plotnine is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python.\n              The grammar allows users to compose plots by explicitly mapping\n              data to the visual objects that make up the plot. plotnine WCSAxes WCSAxes is a framework for making plots of Astronomical data in\n              Matplotlib.
