# AI Optimization Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive set of components for optimizing AI API usage, focusing on:

1. **Dynamic Model Selection** - Automatically choosing the most appropriate AI model based on task complexity
2. **Hybrid Caching System** - Reducing API costs through exact and semantic caching
3. **Cost Tracking and Monitoring** - Detailed tracking and analysis of API usage costs
4. **Real-time Dashboard** - Visualizing costs, usage patterns, and optimization opportunities

These components work together to provide a robust, cost-effective, and GDPR-compliant solution for AI API usage.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dynamic Model Selection (`scripts/ai/model_switcher.py`)

This component analyzes the complexity of prompts and code context to determine the most appropriate model:

- **Complexity Analysis**: Evaluates prompt length, code complexity, and presence of reasoning keywords
- **Model Selection**: Routes to different models based on complexity and GDPR requirements
- **Cost Estimation**: Provides upfront cost estimates before making API calls
- **Input Anonymization**: Removes sensitive information from prompts for GDPR compliance

Models configured:
- **GPT-4o Mini** - For simple tasks (cost-effective)
- **Claude Sonnet** - For medium complexity tasks (GDPR-compliant via T-Systems)
- **DeepSeek R1** - For complex reasoning tasks (powerful capabilities)

### 2. Hybrid Caching System (`scripts/ai/prompt_cache.py`)

Implements a two-tier caching system:

- **Exact Match Caching**: Retrieves cached responses for identical prompts
- **Semantic Caching**: Uses embeddings to find similar prompts above a configurable similarity threshold
- **Cache Management**: Handles TTL-based expiration and size limits
- **Embedding Generation**: Uses SentenceTransformers for generating text embeddings

Features:
- Configurable similarity threshold (default: 0.85)
- Time-based cache expiration (default: 30 days)
- Maximum cache size management
- Graceful fallback when embedding libraries aren't available

### 3. Cost Tracking and Monitoring (`scripts/ai/cost_tracker.py`)

Provides comprehensive tracking and analysis of API usage:

- **API Call Recording**: Stores detailed information about each API call
- **Budget Management**: Tracks daily and monthly spending against configurable budgets
- **Alert System**: Sends notifications when budget thresholds are reached
- **Cost Analysis**: Generates reports on usage patterns and costs
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Suggests improvements based on usage patterns

The data is stored in SQLite for easy querying and persistence.

### 4. Real-time Dashboard (`scripts/ai/dashboard.py`)

A Streamlit-based dashboard for visualizing:

- **Key Metrics**: Today's cost, monthly cost, budget remaining, cache hit rate
- **Daily Trends**: Charts showing costs and API calls over time
- **Model Breakdown**: Distribution of costs and token usage across models
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Cost per token and average cost per call by model
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for optimizing usage

The dashboard supports filtering, exporting data, and auto-refreshing.

### 5. Integration Example (`scripts/ai/example_usage.py`)

Demonstrates how to use all components together in a complete workflow:

- Processes prompts of varying complexity
- Shows how caching works for repeated and similar prompts
- Records API calls in the cost tracker
- Displays cost summaries and optimization recommendations

## GDPR Compliance Measures

The implementation includes several features for GDPR compliance:

1. **Input Anonymization**: Automatically detects and redacts sensitive information
2. **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all API calls
3. **Model Selection**: Prioritizes GDPR-compliant models when required
4. **Data Minimization**: Only stores necessary information for analytics

## Next Steps

1. **API Integration**: Connect to actual API endpoints for the configured models
2. **Authentication**: Add secure API key management
3. **Advanced Anonymization**: Enhance the anonymization capabilities
4. **Notification Channels**: Implement Slack/email notifications for budget alerts
5. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune caching parameters based on actual usage

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for optimizing AI API usage, reducing costs, and ensuring GDPR compliance. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization to meet specific requirements.
